# About
This is repo that i practice from [exploring-elasticsearch-with-docker](https://markheath.net/post/exploring-elasticsearch-with-docker). This repo help u learn how to start and upgrade a new version for elastics.

In this tutorial we saw that not only is it really easy to get an instance of Elasticsearch running with Docker that we could use for experimenting with the API, but with Docker Compose we can define collections of containers that can communicate with one another and start them all easily with docker-compose up.

 
# Content 
- Start a new container running Elasticsearch
- Use Docker Compose to create an Elasticsearch cluster
- Upgrade the cluster to 6.4.2
- Upgrade to a three node cluster
- Add Kibana and head plugin
